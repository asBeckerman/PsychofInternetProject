    The internet helps perpetuate some of the ways in which we perceive social and emotional situations.

    The trust of a page is also an important social perceptual component. People will perceive a website more positively if they have previously had a pleasant experience on that site. People are also more likely to trust a website if they have more perceived control or if the site appears to be easy to use.<sup>2</sup>
